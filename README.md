# Conviction Markets

Conviction Markets allow users to influence decision making by staking their capital on a their preferred option.

Which option the user voted for and with how much stake is stored encrypted on chain and only revealed when the market creator has revealed their choice. Those who put their stake in the chosen option can claim yield. All participants can claim their initial stake back.

## Build & Test

Arcium v0.6.3 required.

Before testing, make sure you build without the feature `hosted-compdefs`.
In `programs/conviction_market/Cargo.toml` make sure it's not in the defaults array.


```bash
yarn install
arcium build
arcium test
```

## Deployment

1. Enable the `hosted-compdefs` feature by adding to the  defaults in `programs/conviction_market/Cargo.toml`
2. Update the program `declare_id!` macro to use your program keypair's pubkey
3. Run `arcium build with --skip-keys-sync` (last argument ensures step 2. isn't overwritten)
4. Make sure in your Anchor.toml file, the `conviction_market` address matches address of step 2 (in the `[programs.localnet]` section if you have no devnet config there!)

Run `arcium deploy` with the correct parameters.

```bash
arcium deploy --cluster-offset 456 \
  --recovery-set-size 4 \
  --keypair-path <PAYER KEYPAIR> \
  --rpc-url <YOUR RPC URL> \
  --program-keypair  <PROGRAM KEYPAIR > \
  --program-name "conviction_market"
```

Run the compute defs script to initialize compute definitions.

```bash
PROGRAM_ID=<YOUR PROGRAM ID> \
ARCIUM_CLUSTER_OFFSET=456 \
KEYPAIR_PATH=<PAYER KEYPAIR> \
RPC_URL=<YOUR RPC URL> \
npx ts-node scripts/compute-defs.ts
```

## Structure

- `programs/conviction_market/` - Anchor program
- `encrypted-ixs/` - MPC circuits (Arcis)
- `tests/` - Integration tests

## Accounts

| Account | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `ConvictionMarket` | Market config, encrypted available shares |
| `ConvictionMarketOption` | Named voting option |
| `VoteTokenAccount` | User's encrypted token balance |
| `ConvictionMarketShare` | User's encrypted position (shares + option) |

## Flow

1. Create market with max options, total shares, time windows
2. Add named options
3. Fund market with SOL, set open timestamp
4. Users mint vote tokens (SOL → encrypted balance)
5. Users buy shares with encrypted inputs (amount + selected option)

## MPC Circuits

- `init_vote_token_account` - Initialize user balance to 0 // TODO: probably can get rid of this circuit...
- `calculate_vote_token_balance` - Buy/sell vote tokens
- `init_market_shares` - Initialize market's available shares
- `buy_conviction_market_shares` - Purchase shares, deduct from user and market balances
